# Meetup Site
#This site is for organising Meetup events around the world.
# I used React (Functional Components, Hooks, Context) to create it. I also use Firebase as database.
With the App you can add new events, what will be saved on Firebase server, login, sigin possible. Save prefered meetup events.
